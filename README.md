# Responsive-Restaurant-Menu-Website
## What is this Website about?
Welcome to my restaurant website project! This website was created as part of a web development assignment focused on building responsive and visually appealing web pages using only HTML and CSS. The site represents a professional, modern restaurant and includes everything a real one might need â€” from a warm homepage with images, to a detailed menu, contact information, and a reservation form. It's fully responsive, meaning it adjusts and looks good on different devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This project helped me practice structuring multi-page websites, organizing content clearly, and using CSS media queries to adapt layouts for various screen sizes.

## Pages Included
- **Home**: Welcoming message + restaurant image
- **Menu**: Starters, Mains, Desserts, and Drinks (with prices)
- **About**: Restaurant history, mission, and team
- **Contact**: Contact form + contact details + map image
